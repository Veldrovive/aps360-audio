# Contrastive Audio Genre Prediction

This repository contains code necessary to train a contrastive embedding model on the MTG dataset which can then be used in genre prediction (e.g. on the GTZAN dataset).

All code an documentation can be found in [/project.ipynb](/project.ipynb).

Up to the section titled "High Level Classifier Training Loop", you should run every cell. This is all setup and loading the data. Each section after that can be run individually to produce results for a specific type of model.
